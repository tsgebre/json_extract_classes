# json_extract_classes
Here's an example code in Python to process an MS COCO JSON annotation file and extract annotations for 10 specific classes. This code assumes you have the 'json' module installed in your Python environment.

In this code, you need to specify the path to your original COCO JSON file (coco_json_file). You also need to define the names of the 10 classes you want to extract (class_names). The code will then extract the annotations for the 10 classes and save them to a new JSON file (class_annotations.json).

Note that this code assumes that your original COCO JSON file has the standard format with the info, licenses, images, annotations, and categories fields. If your JSON file has a different structure, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
